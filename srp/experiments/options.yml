### Options for a grid search over possible parametere.
#
# See 'make_experiments' for an example that uses the data.
#
# Each decision we wish to test is a top-level elements,
# the different options for that decision are listed below
# it a YAML list.
#
###

# Whether to do early fusion or late fusion. Fusion can be done by either adding or concatenating the
# channels. Adding the channels wont work for early fusion since the inputs have different numbers of
# channels.
FUSION:
- early_fusion
- late_fusion_add
- late_fusion_cat

# How we represent the Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs) when we compute the loss. Each representation has more
# degrees of freedom.
OBB_PARAMETRIZATION:
- vector_and_width
- two_vectors
- four_points

# Whether to include synthetic data in the first few epochs.
SYNTHETIC:
- no_pretrain
- pretrain

# Whether to use channel dropout -- I actually mean droping an input source.
# The idea is to prevent it from becoming overly reliant on one source of data.
CHANNEL_DROPOUT:
- cdrop
- no_cdrop

# Which loss function to use when deciding if it is an object (box) or background.
CLASS_LOSS:
- hinge_loss
- xent_loss

# Which loss to use when predicting the parameters of the OBB
REGRESSION_LOSS:
- smooth_L1
- L2

  # Whether to apply jitter to the input sources to simulate registration issues
AUG_JITTER:
- no_jitter
- jitter
